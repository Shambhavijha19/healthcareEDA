# Hospital Emergency Room - Data Analysis

**By Shambhavi Jha**

## Why I Made This

Honestly, this project started because I was curious. I kept reading about how overcrowded emergency rooms are becoming a real problem - long wait times, frustrated patients, overworked staff. And I thought, what if we could actually look at the data and find patterns that might help?

I got my hands on this ER dataset and decided to dig in. What started as a weekend exploration turned into a full analysis because the more I looked, the more interesting things I found.

## What This Project Does

This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of hospital emergency room visits. I wanted to understand:

- Who's coming to the ER? (demographics, age groups, etc.)
- How long are people actually waiting?
- Are patients satisfied with their experience?
- Which departments get the most referrals?
- Are there patterns by time of day or day of week?

## What's Inside

- `Healthcare_EDA_Analysis.ipynb` - The main analysis notebook with all visualizations
- `Hospital ER.csv` - The dataset
- `dashboard_summary.png` - A quick visual summary (generated after running the notebook)

## Some Interesting Findings

Without spoiling everything in the notebook:

- Wait times vary A LOT depending on when you show up
- There's a pretty clear relationship between wait time and patient satisfaction (no surprise there)
- Weekends vs weekdays show different patterns
- Certain age groups have higher admission rates

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn
2. Open the Jupyter notebook
3. Run all cells

That's it. Nothing fancy.

## Tech Used

- Python 3
- Pandas for data wrangling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook

## Final Thoughts

This was a learning project for me. I'm not claiming to have solved healthcare or anything like that. But I do think there's value in looking at data like this - even simple patterns can point to areas for improvement.

If you're working on something similar or have suggestions, feel free to reach out!
